## How to build

    # code resides in a private GitLab repo and can only be accessed with two-factor authentication
    # So first you must create a personal access token for your GitLab account, then
    git clone https://TOKEN_NAME:TOKEN@gitlab.com/theias/hpc/jmstone/athena-parthenon/athenak.git athenaK
    cd athenaK
